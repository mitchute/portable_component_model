Notes from Ryan:

./run_GHE from the command line will compile and execute GHE_main.cpp in a single command. 

Outputs will be written to ../outputs.csv. The data can be acessed through ../outputs_excel.xlsx which uses a power query on the csv file. In the excel menu bar click data and then 'Refresh All' to update the workbook after a run of the model.

Building load and number of iterations are hard coded, along with GHE and HP properties.
